# Upload API Client (Upload.js Edition)

**Client stubs for the Upload API.**

- A cut-down version of [`upload-api-client`](https://github.com/upload-io/upload-api-client) for [Upload.js](https://github.com/upload-js/upload-js).

- Only includes endpoints required by Upload.js.

- Uses XHR (to support widest range of browsers).

## Updating the stubs

The stubs have been manually edited -- extensively -- to reduce the payload size. (Really, we should fork the generator.)

If you need to regenerate, check out the diff, and cherry-pick in the changes you need, rather than accepting the
generated result wholesale.

To regenerate:

```
npm run generate
```
